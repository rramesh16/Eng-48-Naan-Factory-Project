## Specification of the Factory

Our factory will have two step process

### Making the dough 
Our factory should take in water and flour to make dough.
- inputs = 'water' and 'flour'
- outputs = 'dough'

### Baking the dough
Then put the dough in the oven to produce the Naan 
- inputs = 'dough'
- outputs = 'Naan'

### Factory run 
Lastly we should only give the factory water and flour to make the Naan.
-  inputs = 'water' and 'flour'
- outputs = 'Naan'
